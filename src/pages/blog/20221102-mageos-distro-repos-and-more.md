title: Beyond the Mirror - Mage-OS Distribution Nightly Builds!
description: Now available on nightly.mage-os.org
---

As we all are busy bees, a lot has been happening!

## The Mage-OS community is growing!

New faces are joining the meetings and more and more people are eager to contribute. Very exciting!  
Please join the fun and chime in on [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org). The volume of messages still is very manageable.


## Mage-OS Distribution Repositories

The GitHub repositories forming the foundation of the independent Mage-OS distribution have been set up.  
GitHub workflows automatically merge upstream changes. In case of a merge conflict, notifications are sent out and the automatic merge process is paused until the conflict is resolved by a human.  
Special thanks to [Daniel Sloof](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/1) for creating the workflow, and [Damien Retzinger](https://github.com/damienwebdev) as well as [Vinai Kopp](https://github.com/vinai) for helping to set them up for all the repos!

## GitHub Permissions

Mage-OS GitHub access permissions and PR review rules are now [enforced by Terraform](https://github.com/mage-os/terraform).  
This automation helps avoid human error and eases the overall maintenance burden on contributors.  
Thank you to [Simon Sprankel](https://github.com/sprankhub) for leading the effort, and also (in no particular order) [Jakub Pie≈Ñkowski](https://github.com/Jakski), [Vitaliy Golomoziy](https://github.com/vitaliy-golomoziy), [Andreas Mautz](https://twitter.com/mautz_et_tong) and [Alexander Buch](https://twitter.com/keen_code) ([cartware.de](https://www.cartware.de/)) for contributing!

## Roadmap

The immediate next step is to finalize CI for the nightly builds for the distribution repositories, and to set up testing.

We then are looking forward to starting accepting pull requests by the end of December 2022!
Figuring out the best way to handle them will take time, so please be patient with us!


(Much) more soon, thanks for reading üôåüèª

The Mage-OS folks!
