Diversity and Inclusion is an important and complex topic that is close to our heart because we strongly believe that a wide array of points of view and perspectives can only bring richer insights, fairer decisions and has proven to be a key factor of success in any type of business.

Today we want to share our thoughts and address early feedback we received, in particular regarding the lack of geographical diversity in the governance of Mage-OS Association.

Today, our board is made up of seven males and one female who serves as the Vice President with responsibilities to make decisions on behalf of the President.

Our Business Control Committee meets gender parity as it comprises one male and one female

The nine individuals are spread between seven countries in Europe and North America. It is not yet the role model for diversity and inclusion that we are aiming for. We need your help to get there.

### How did we get to this situation?
When we decided to become active and save the Magento Open Source ecosystem, the conversations happened to be between friends and business partners clustered in Europe.  
We felt an urgent need to move fast, and in order to be able to do that we kept the group small and agile.  
We, the Mage-OS Association, do not believe we represent the whole “Magento Community”. We are but one part of it. That said, we also believe we can grow that part.

### Where to now?
The strategy of keeping the steering group small enabled us to move fast and create results. However, now that we have created a solid foundation, we want to grow to represent more of the Magento Community, while continuing our momentum.  
The Mage-OS Association has been founded, but still is very young. We have technical processes and infrastructure, but they are far from complete. We have [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) as a community hub, but it is still small.  
These foundational key stones will enable us to grow and evolve, and include everyone in the Magento Community that agrees with our core values, our purpose.  

### Leadership & Board Membership
A couple of times already I’ve heard that the Mage-OS Board should have representation from other geographic regions. And we all agree, this would be the ideal state.

However, it is not possible to have a board position only to represent.

Being on the board means doing whatever work is required, without compensation, for now, in addition to a regular job. This commitment enables Mage-OS to achieve its goals.

Anybody who takes it on themselves to do the necessary work, will naturally become influential within the Mage-OS project.  
Even without a position on the board, the direction of Mage-OS can be influenced significantly by engaged individuals who take responsibility and put in the hours.

The next time board positions are open for election, it is likely that those engaged persons will become part of the board.

Demonstrating commitment and leadership come first, the official roles and titles follow.

**Aside:** *Board members are elected by the general assembly, which consists of all Mage-OS Association members. Half of the board member positions will be up for election in two years, the other half in three. After this initial cycle the term of office for all board members is two years.*

### Overcoming Privilege
Putting in many hours into open source work for free is only possible when being in a privileged position. Creating a diverse and inclusive board with global representation, while also requiring work for free is a dilemma. We believe it can be resolved over time through constant awareness and attention.

In the ideal scenario, the Mage-OS Association is able to pay members from less privileged situations to work on Mage-OS, and allow them to gain influence and take on official roles. This will allow real diversity and this has been part of the vision for Mage-OS from the beginning.

That said, currently there are no funds to distribute. The next step for the Mage-OS Association is to acquire funds.  
Because one of the key values of Mage-OS is independence, the majority of funds will come through membership fees. This allows us to pay for services like email and hosting instead of relying on sponsorship.  
At one point we will be able to hire a Chief Operating Officer, who will work full time on running the association and grow it further. After that we can start funding members to work on Mage-OS. As you can see, there is still a way to go, but by taking one step after the other we will get there.  

We are aware that Diversity is not just about geography and culture and we are eager to also hear your thoughts and ideas on how we can be improved further in other areas such as Gender Equality.

We look forward to working with you on creating the future of Mage-OS!

### Local Representation
The Magento family is a global network made up of business and friendship.  
Board members can’t travel to all events. Constant travel is unsustainable for individuals and the environment.  
Nevertheless, we feel local representation of Mage-OS within the Magento Community is super important.  
This is why we need local Mage-OS representatives!

Representatives attend Magento and eCommerce events in their region to give Mage-OS visibility, answer questions, and gather ideas and feedback from the local community (merchants, developers, agencies and service providers). Then they share this information in the Mage-OS [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) to raise awareness of their local situation.

If time allows and if interested, representatives can also organize Magento meetups and give presentations about Mage-OS at events.  
Representatives from different regions can support each other by sharing slides, processes and experiences.

We invite you to become a Mage-OS representative for your geographic location!

What you can do today!

Please help us:
1. Develop the Mage-OS local representation by letting us know you are interested in [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/)!
2. Share best practices for tech companies and organizations to be more inclusive and diverse by highlighting the resources you found useful, via [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) or email: info@mage-os.org
