description: About the Mage-OS Association
---

The Mage-OS Association is a non-profit association formed by people within the Magento community to represent and further the interests of that community as a whole: Merchants, developers, agencies, and all of the many people supporting and supported by this ecosystem.

The ideas behind Mage-OS were first shared in an [open letter about the future of Magento](/block/the-future-of-magento). That letter prompted discussions and action across the community. The letter was signed by 1,641 people that use, develop, or otherwise depend on Magento for a living. Mage-OS brings the ideas of that letter to life.

Mage-OS is incorporated in Poland, but is represented worldwide.
