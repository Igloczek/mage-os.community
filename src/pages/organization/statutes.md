Any member with a formal role in the Mage-OS Association shall be entitled to leave the Association by giving one months' written notice to the Board of Directors.

All other members may leave the Association at any time by giving notice to the Board of Directors, or by not renewing membership at the end of a membership year. Any dues paid prior to leaving the Association will be considered support for the Association’s activities, and will not be refunded.

Membership shall also end upon dissolution of the legal person or the death of the member.


### Art. 7 - Suspension or termination of membership

Any member that violates statutes, regulations, resolutions, code of conduct, or otherwise acts in a manner that is seriously contrary to the interests of the Association, can have their membership suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors must notify the person of the grounds for the action, and prepare a resolution for review at the next Board of Directors meeting.

Before the resolution is voted on, the Board of Directors shall give the member an opportunity to state his/her position. The Board should inform the member about the planned date of resolution. The Board is not bound by the state of the member under review.

Any person can report misconduct of a member to the Board of Directors. In such case, the Board shall investigate, and if unacceptable behavior is determined to have occurred, the Board of Directors will be entitled to terminate, suspend, or send written warning to the member to change their conduct. If warned, the Board is entitled to suspend a member if the member’s conduct has not improved during two weeks after being given a warning.

Termination or suspension of membership shall require a majority decision by the Board of Directors.

A member can be suspended for a fixed period of time, no longer than 12 months.

Termination of a membership will be considered indefinite. A terminated member shall be entitled to appeal the decision with the Board of Directors no less than six months after their membership is terminated. The Board’s decision on the appeal is final.

Terminated members may be reinstated only upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office. Suspended members will be reinstated at the conclusion of their suspension term, or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors.

Terminated or suspended members are deprived of any active or passive right to vote, and may not participate in any Association activities, until such a time as their membership is restored.

### Art. 14 - Election of Board members and term of office

Only regular and honorary members of the Mage-OS Association can be elected to the Board. Re-election is permitted. The Board shall have a minimum of six and a maximum of nine members.

The term of office for the Board of Directors is two years, with each year starting July 1st.

The inaugural Board of Directors is selected by the founding members. Four of the inaugural board members will be selected by the Board to have a term of three years. This will serve to ensure continuity via rolling board member replacement in the future.

At the end of each term of office, elections for vacated seats of the Board of Directors will be held during the General Assembly.

Every member of the Mage-OS Association may nominate themselves or another member for candidacy in the Board election. Nominees must confirm their candidacy in advance. Written notice of proposed Board candidates must be submitted to the Board no later than seven days before the General Assembly. Nominees may apply for a particular role in the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may be elected during the General Assembly, or prior to the General Assembly by online voting. In this case, members must be granted a reasonable advance term for the announcement of Board candidates.

The outcome of the election shall be decided by counting the votes received by the candidates. In case of tie votes for excess candidates, there shall be a second ballot; in case of another tie vote, the decision will be made by lot.

The election and assignment of functions (president, vice president, actuary, and treasurer) shall be performed during or prior to the General Assembly, before the start of a new term of office, by a simple majority of the attending members.

Candidates for the office of president must have held a position on the Board of Directors previously.

Termination of Mage-OS Association membership also terminates the office of a Board of Directors member.

In the case of by-elections during the term of office, the newly elected Board member completes the predecessor’s term of office. Instead of by-elections, the Board of Directors may also ask the next ranking candidate from the previous election whether they want to move up. If more than three Board members step down during a term of office, new elections must be held for all vacated positions via a Special Assembly.

Intent to leave the Board of Directors must be declared in writing. In this case, the obligations to the Association for the current year of membership must be fulfilled.

In the event that a Board of Directors member fails to uphold their duties or is otherwise absent from Board activities for a period of 30 consecutive days without notice, the Board may vote to remove the office and responsibilities of that member. In that event, the removed member’s position in the Board of Directors shall be considered vacant.

If a member of the Board of Directors resigns during their term, or in the event a position in the Board of Directors is vacant, the other members of the Board of Directors take over the responsibilities until the position is filled.


### Art. 15 - Quorum, circular resolutions, decision of the President

Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be convened by the President of the Board, as often as business matters may require.

The Board of Directors shall have a quorum if at least four of the members of the Board are present for a meeting.

The President can call for circular resolutions. A circular resolution shall be valid only with the unanimous vote of all members of the Board.

The Board of Directors should strive for consensus in its decisions. The Board shall decide matters through a majority vote of the members of the Board present, unless otherwise specified in the statutes. If a vote is tied, the President shall cast the deciding vote.

On request of a member of the Board of Directors, a vote may be conducted by secret ballot. Otherwise, all resolutions shall be recorded in the meeting minutes. Each member of the Board shall be entitled to provide a minority opinion to be included in the minutes.


### Art. 16 - Signature policy

The Business Control Committee shall consist of two members. The term of office of the Business Control Committee shall be two years. Election shall occur through the General Assembly. Re-election is permitted.

Only members of the Mage-OS Association can be elected to serve as members of the Business Control Committee. Members may not serve on the Business Control Committee while also serving on the Board or otherwise receiving Association funds.

Termination of membership in the Mage-OS Association shall also terminate the office of a member of the Business Control Committee.

In the case of by-elections during the term of office, the newly elected member of the Business Control Committee shall complete the term of office of the predecessor. In even years the first half of the members of the Business Control Committee shall be elected, in odd years the second half of the members shall be elected.

The Business Control Committee shall be entitled to review all project loans for expenditure agreement with the loan application, achievement of the cited objectives, and cost-efficient project fulfillment. It shall report to the Board of Directors quarterly and shall report to the General Assembly annually in writing.

The Business Control Committee shall issue Rules of Procedure and shall regulate its tasks and division of responsibility therein.


### Art. 18 - Other committees

The Board of Directors shall be entitled to use advisory committees or individual persons without decision-making authority for special tasks.

Deployment of a new committee requires a written request of a Board member, including justification, scope of the committee's responsibilities, and proposed members of committee. This will be voted by resolution of the Board. The board may accept the proposed members or appoint its own from among members of the Association.

A committee can request changes to its members and chair. This is subject to approval by the Board.


### Art. 19 - Conflicts of interest

Any time a Board member has a financial or personal interest in a matter coming before the Board of Directors, the member and Board must ensure that:

1. The interest of that Board member is fully disclosed.
2. The interested Board member may not vote or lobby on the matter, or be counted in determining the existence of a quorum, at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which such matter is voted upon.
3. Any transaction in which a Board member has a financial or personal interest shall be voted on if determined to be in the best interests of the organization, by members of the Board who do not possess that financial or personal interest in the transaction.
4. Any payments to an interested Board member shall be reasonable and not exceed fair market value.
5. The minutes of meetings at which such votes are taken shall record the disclosure, abstention, and rationale for approval.

All members of the Board, committees, and all persons employed directly or by grants or loans, must avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest with the Association in their behavior and actions. In the event of a significant or persistent conflict, the Board may rule that such person must take actions to mitigate or resolve that conflict.
